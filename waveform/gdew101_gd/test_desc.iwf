[WAVEFORM]
; Waveform Descriptor File

; VERSION is the version of the descriptor, also determines the waveform type
; Only 1.0 is valid so far
VERSION = 1.0

; PREFIX is the filename prefix for actual waveform files
PREFIX = test

; XWIA is the extra info stored into the waveform, usually the name
XWIA = test_v100

; MODES is the total modes supported by the waveform
MODES = 5

; TEMPS is the total number of temperature ranges supported by the waveform
TEMPS = 1

; Define the supported modes (string), not currently used by anything
M0NAME = INIT
M1NAME = DU
M2NAME = GC16
M3NAME = GC4
M4NAME = A2

; Define the frame count for each mode
M0FC = 162
M1FC = 18
M2FC = 38
M3FC = 41
M4FC = 33

; Define the supported temperature in degC
T0RANGE = 25
